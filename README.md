## Content
This repo contains the code and data relative to the paper "Distributed Attack-Resilient Platooning Against False Data Injection"

### Installation
No installation required, all scripts can simply be run in python.

### Distributed_attack_resilient_platooning
This folder contains the code used to aid the theoretical development of the proposed method.

### platooning_experiments_data_processing
This folder contains the experimental data and the code used to generate the figures in the paper. Note that the .bag files recorded during the experiments were compressed due to size issues when uploading.
